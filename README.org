  The main web interface is /read-only/.
  However, it's possible to send commands via the [[Advanced usage][REPL]].
  
* Rationale
  The purpose of BACnet is to provide interoperability between
  devices from multiple manufacturers. 
  
  The idea is that if all devices speak the same language, no one
  will be 'trapped' with a proprietary protocol, forcing him to
  always buy at the same place.
  
  This common language also have other advantages, such as making it
  easy to gather data and make advanced analysis. Simply checking the
  historical data plotted on a graph is enough to find and solve most
  problem.
  
  However, despite all BACnet's promises, the landscape is still
  mostly occupied by a handful of manufacturers. 
  
  In addition, BACnet is pitched as an 'open protocol', but the
  standards need to be ordered; even [[www.bacnet.org][bacnet.org]] doesn't provide a
  link to download the specs. This isn't making it easy for
  newcomers. Want to see and try BACnet? Well, send us money and
  we'll send you a boring pdf, and maybe, maybe you will stick with
  us.
  
  For the developers, there's some highly cryptic application that
  will provide some support, but for the newcomer that's simply
  counterproductive to even try them.
  
  This results in an horrible situations for the users. Building
  managers are often clueless as to what to do with a BACnet network.
  They don't know what's in it, nor do they know how to browse it.
  (Of course manufacturers will offer their own software... for a
  price.) There's nothing wrong with selling software, but for such a
  basic need, browsing the network, a free software should be
  available. It's like comparing Notepad and Word. Sure, sell Word,
  but the user should at least be able to write basic stuff in
  notepad.
  
  *Wacnet* is a humble try to ameliorate the situation. By enabling
  an /easy/ and almost instantaneous setup, anyone can at least see
  what's on the network. Newcomers can explore the different
  properties and learn them.
  
  
* Usage
** Getting the application
   If you know Clojure, download the [[https://github.com/Frozenlock/wacnet][source]] and do =lein uberjar=.
   
   If you do not, download the pre-packaged version at
   [[https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet]].

** Running the application

   No installation necessary and can run from a USB key!

   The standalone jar file can be started on any computer with Java
   installed. We recommend starting it from the command line as such:
:  java -jar <filename>
   
   For example:
:  java -jar wacnet-0.1.1-BETA-standalone.jar
   
   You can of course start it by simply double-clicking on the .jar
   file, but you might have a hard time finding the 'off' switch.
   (You will have to manually kill it.)
   
   Once the application is started, go to [[http://localhost:47800]] and
   browse your network!

** Advanced usage (REPL)
   The REPL is an interactive evaluation environment to enable power
   users to use tools tailored to their needs. If a feature is
   lacking, it's even possible to add it on-the-fly!
   
* Warnings
  This software isn't polished. You might see errors (in which case
  please send them to us).

  There is also no caching, meaning that every time you browse a
  device, it will re-fetch the data from it.
